# FRS_FaceNet
Face Recognition System with FaceNet
This Streamlit app implements a face recognition system using the FaceNet model for feature extraction and an SVM classifier for identification. Users can upload images to detect and label faces, extract facial embeddings, train a recognition model, and test it on new images. The app also allows saving and downloading the trained model and embeddings for future use, providing an end-to-end pipeline for face recognition.
